First of all, welcome! And thanks so much for stopping by our project!! Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) is a program that supports people to tell local environmental and community stories through data investigations, science notebooking and civic engagement. And we are hoping you can help! </p>

### Problem Statement
How might we use paper, low-cost hardware, and the web to: 1) serve and display ambient live data and 2) support engagement models based on the curation of large datasets and unique polling and citizen science projects, which are organized around scientific and civic-minded teaching and learning prompts for data gathering and creative community-building activities?

## What are we doing?
Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) supports communities  to tell the stories of their local environmental and civic concerns using science journaling, crafted visualization, and data investigation.
 
Currently The program is composed of a series of data investigation activities that start as extremely basic and work up to more complex data investigations.

The activities are enabled by a set of hardware data collection and visualization tools, still in protytpe form.

---I need to finish this section----

## Who are we?

The primary ODOM team is [Elisabeth Sylvan](http://lisard.com), [David Cole](http://cv2.com) and [Natalie Freed](http://nataliefreed.com). Elisabeth and David work at the nonprofit [Nexmap](http://www.nexmap.org) and are Fellows at [Manylabs](http://manylabs.org), an open science hacker space in San Francisco. Natalie is a computational artist and high school teacher who develops the user interaction and hardware. Additional engineering support is by Jie Qi and the UK firm [Artists and Engineers](http://artistsandengineers.co.uk) in partnership with industrial designer, Roland Ellis. 

ODOM has received support and funding by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/), the [National Writing Project](https://www.nwp.org/), and several individual funders.

## What do we need?

If you are  interested in science or  concerned about how well citizens understand scientific information, we need your help! More specifically we need data lovers, statistics gurus, learners, educators, evaluation researchers, to help with the following 

* reviewing and editing ODOM's curriculum and other educational materials
* reviewing and writing the program's research evaluation plan and tools
* evaluating and developing the design of our research process
* evaluating and making suggestions for our planned statistics and graphics generator 
* suggesting and helping us think through architectural and technical issues

Check out our [issues](ISSUES.md) page for specific requests!
