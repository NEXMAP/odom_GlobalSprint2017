# [ Open Data/Open Minds ]

First of all, welcome! And thanks so much for stopping by our project!! Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) is a program that supports people to tell local environmental and community stories through data investigations, science notebooking and civic engagement. 

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## What are we doing?

### The problem

* To be a critical consumer of scientific information, people need to be able to understand and critique scientific information in their world. 


### The solution

Open Data/Open Minds will:

* do these great things.


## Who are we?

The ODOM team consists of Elisabeth Sylvan, David Cole and Natalie Freed. Elisabeth and David work at the nonprofit Nexmap and are Fellows at Manylabs, an open science hacker space in San Francisco. Natalie is XXX. There's more information about them (and some pictures) in the [MeetTheTeam](MeetTheTeam.md) file.

ODOM has received support and funding by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/), the [National Writing Project](https://www.nwp.org/), and several individual funders.

## What do we need?

If you are  interested in science or  concerned about how well citizens understand scientific information, we need your help! More specifically we need data lovers, statistics gurus, learners, educators, evaluation researchers, to help with the following 

* reviewing and editing ODOM's curriculum and other educational materials
* reviewing and writing the program's research evaluation plan and tools
* evaluating and developing the design of our research process
* evaluating and making suggestions for our planned statistics and graphics generator 
* suggesting and helping us think through architectural and technical issues
## Get involved
